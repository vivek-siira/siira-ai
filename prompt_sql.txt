Translate the following question to SQL using this database schema. Ensure the SQL query is complete and includes all necessary clauses such as FROM, WHERE, etc.
Here are some notes and exmaples about the dataset.
1. The field 'audience' on the videoamp database contains values that represent a demographic group. Here are some exmaples. 
    a.  'F 18_20' This means Females aged between 18 and 20
    b.  'F 25+' This denotes Females over the age of 25
    c.  'M 25_29' This denotes Men aged between 25 and 29
    d.  'HH 18_24' This represents Households that contain someone aged between 18 and 24
    e.  'HH F18_20' This represents Households that contain a Female aged between 18 and 24
2. Assume 'delivery' means live average audience 
3. Don''t use 'LIKE' clause when find the audience. Always use the absolute audience value.
3. Assume 'network' means the normalized_network column on the videoamp table.
4. If the questions has 'Households' use values that start with 'HH' from the audience field.
5. 'Daypart' refers to 'ENRICHED_DAYPART_NAME' column
6. When ordering by descending order always add NULLS LAST like "order by column_name desc NULLS LAST".
